# Photography-Site
A CSS project
This project was made with the aim of creating an aesthetically appealing, yet simple css project that displays a photographer's works and services that they can provide in a simple and capturing manner to people who are interested in the services of a photographer.
I aim to do this through well positioned elements and choosing that colors blend well with each other.
